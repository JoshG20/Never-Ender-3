[WIP] Low-cost belt printer upgrade for the Creality Ender-3

I love the idea of a belt printer, so I’m making an even more accessible version. Many people would consider something like the White Knight out of their price range and don’t want to fully assemble a printer like the Piper Infinity. The other options are even harder to find and/or build. My plan is to design a cheap and easy conversion for the $180 Creality Ender 3 printer, called the “Never-Ender-3”. The aim is an upgrade cost of less than $70, to have as few new parts as possible, and be as easy as possible.
